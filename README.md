<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
  This project's main idea was to learn some Full Stack (MERN) development by learning integrating frontend, backend and databases together. It is made from scratch to publishing. 
  No classes were used in creating this SPA. I focused on using React's 16.8+ hooks because I think they're much better than a class-based system. Also, a 
  heavy focus was on learning node.js and its features in-depth. The back-end has been connected to MongoDB and to help with that it is using Axios & 
  mongoose.
